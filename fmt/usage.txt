Usage: alignment <file> [-n --nevents] [-v --var] [-i --inter]

  * file      : hipo input file.
  * nevents   : number of events to run. If unspecified, runs all
                events in input file.
  * var       : variable to be aligned. Can be dXY, dZ, rXY, or rZ.
  * inter (2) : [0] range between nominal position and position to
                    be tested.
                [1] step size for each tested value between
                    <nominal - range> and <nominal + range>.
  * swim  (3) : Setup for the Swim class. If unspecified, uses
                default from RG-F data (-0.75, -1.0, 3.0).
                [0] Solenoid magnet scale.
                [1] Torus magnet scale.
                [2] Solenoid magnet shift.
  * cutsinfo  : int describing how much info on the cuts should be
                printed. 0 is no info, 1 is minimal, 2 is detailed.
                Default is 1.
  * variation : CCDB variation to be used. Default is
                ``rgf_spring2020''.
  * plot      : int describing if plots are to be shown. 1 means
                show them. Plots are always saved in the
                ``histograms.hipo'' file.
  * dx    (3) : x shift for each FMT layer.
  * dy    (3) : y shift for each FMT layer.
  * dz    (3) : z shift for each FMT layer.
  * rx    (3) : x rotation for each FMT layer.
  * ry    (3) : y rotation for each FMT layer.
  * rz    (3) : z rotation for each FMT layer.

For example, if var == dZ, inter == 0.2 0.1, and
dz == 0.5, then the values tested for z are:
            (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7).
If a position or rotation is not specified, it is assumed to be 0
for all FMT layers. If no argument is specified, a plot showing
the residuals is shown.

NOTE. All measurements are in cm, while the ccdb works in mm.
